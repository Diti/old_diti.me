This book taught me everything I wanted to know about Android programming, and,
most importantly, about practical Java.

While studying at [EFREI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFREI), and being given
mathematics-related assignments (statistics, linear algebra) in which a computer
proof was required, I thought it would be more interesting, more _fun_, to make
Android apps.

I knew the basics of object-oriented programming, I knew the basics of Java.
This book helped me gradually discover the Android SDK and how Android
components interact with each other.

This was an interesting read as a beginner. However, two things really put me
off:

  1. I didn’t like the writing style—always going into great details, instead of
     focusing on simplicity.
  2. The obligation to download the author’s code to follow the lessons—I would
     rather create more simple applications (as a beginner), than trying to
     achieve the same result as the author.
