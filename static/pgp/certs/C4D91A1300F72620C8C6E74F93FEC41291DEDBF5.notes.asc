OpenPGP certification notes from key `0x31A49121CD42FF00`
===============================================================================

This digitally-signed document provides details about the OpenPGP certification
process (also known as "key signing") that occured between myself ("Diti") and
the person having their key certificated (the "signee").

In this certification, both *Diti and signee are the same person* (myself).

  - "Diti" represents my main OpenPGP key
  - "Signee" represents my newly-created OpenPGP smartcard 

More information about my key certification process may be found at this URL:  
http://diti.me/pgp/#policy

  - Diti's fingerprint:    `FD4F 1D56 6452 19A0 C6F6  F9AB 31A4 9121 CD42 FF00`
  - Signee's fingerprint:  `C4D9 1A13 00F7 2620 C8C6  E74F 93FE C412 91DE DBF5`

### Details of the event ###

Date:        2014-03-07  
Location:    Sucy-en-Brie, France  

Notes:
  - Signee allowed Diti to be a revoker: `gpg --edit-key 91DEDBF5 addrevoker`
  - Diti certified signee's card with a full trust; if I ever were to certify
    other people's public keys using my smartcard, it would be as if I had
    signed them with my main key. `gpg --edit-key 91DEDBF5 tsign`
  - Diti/signee generated a revocation certificate (in the event the card is
    lost of stolen).
